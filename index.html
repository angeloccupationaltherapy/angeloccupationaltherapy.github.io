				<h3> What is occupational therapy? </h3>
				<h4>
				<p>
					Occupational therapy is all about enabling others to do their occupation and live their life. Whether it's early intervention for a toddler with autism<sup>1</sup> or memory exercises for a senior in a nursing home, all occupational therapy is guided by the principle of increasing skills or adpating environments to people so they may become as independent, emotionally and physically pain free, and capable as possible.</p> <p> For a child, their functional activity might sound as simple as being able to play ball or talk with friends! Occupational therapy aims to help treat physical disabilities, mental health disorders, and developmental delays or disabilities. </p> <p>To learn more, look through some of the articles below.<sup>2 3</sup></p>
